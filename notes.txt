Why Golang?
    Memory Efficient
    Efficient Concurrency 
    Performance equivalent to 'C' language
    Easy to learn
    Cloud friendly

    Simplicity
        25 keywords
            package, import, var, func, if, for, switch, select, make, close, chan, range, return, break, continue, fallthrough, struct, interface, type, go, in, out 

        No access modifiers (private, public, protected etc..)
        No classes (Only structs & functions)
        No inheritance (prefer composition over inheritance)
        No exceptions (only errors)
        No 'try catch finally' construct

        Analysis Paralysis
        Barry Shwartz 
            The Paradox of Choice (TED )(Book)

    Concurrency
        Golang is built for Concurrency
        language features 
            go, chan, <-, select, close, range
        Memory Efficient
            Goroutine = 4KB vs OS thread = 8 MB
            Thousands of goroutines can be spawned using 1 OS thread
            Builtin in Scheduler

    Cloud Native Friendly
